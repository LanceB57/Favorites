Hi there! This is a C++ AI Connect Four game I created at my school's local hackathon.

In this game, you play against an AI that I have coded using the minimax method.
The difficulty that the user chooses will be how many turns the AI will plan for.
For example, if the difficulty is 3, then the AI will try all possibilities for the next three turns.
As of right now, the difficulty is limited to 4. (Level 5 takes too long for the progam)

Have fun!

(Note that I have not error-proofed this code, so please play according to the rules!)
