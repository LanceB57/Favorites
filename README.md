My favorite programs! Feel free to take a look!

Also please make sure that:

   1. You are in the directory when you run the program, as almost all of them require access to other files in the same
   directory.

   2. You have all appropriate libraries downloaded before running.
   
   3. You read the INSTRUCTIONS.txt in each directory before running. They'll tell you how the program works!

Hope you enjoy!
