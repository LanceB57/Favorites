Want to do High Intensity Interval Training but have trouble looking at the time while exercising?
Then this is the python program for you!

I made this program because I personally found it difficult to constantly check my phone for how much time had gone by while I did HIIT.

This program will read out loud your exercise as well as how many seconds you have to do it.
After that time is up, it will immediately move onto the next.

In order to modify the program to your own workout, simply modify workout.txt in the following format:

(Workout name) (Number of seconds)

For example, the first workout that is filled in workout.txt would be Dumbbell Curls for 60 seconds.
The program will read this out loud and then read aloud the next workout once those 60 seconds are up.

Please make sure that you have all appropriate libraries downloaded before running workout.py.

Hope this helps you out!
