End of the year project

Welcome to our end of the year project! 
This machine learning project was created by Shay Mor (https://github.com/shay-m) and Lance Bae in June 2020.
You can see our original project repository here: https://github.com/shay-m/pi-math

Our program in main.py opens a tkinter window where you can perform single-digit operations. 
Draw your first digit in the first box, your symbol in the second (only add, subtract, multiply, and divide),
and your second digit in the second box. 
The program will process what you drew and try to predict what you wrote!
(Only single digit numbers are supported as of right now)

Alternatively to digits, you can also use variables. 
The supported variables are a, b, c, and d. 
You can assign values to these variables by using the equals symbol (ex: b = 2 makes b equal to 2). 
Note that the variable a stores the answer of your previous expression (basically "ans" on a TI-84). 
All variables are initialized with value 0.
When using variables, make sure to check the box above the window where you drew it!

Please do not try to move the tkinter window around, as this will almost definitely mess up our image-capturing system.
Still working on a fix!

We used tensorflow and researched a lot ourselves to create the models that allow this program to work as well as it does. 
We trained our models using a dataset at: https://www.kaggle.com/xainano/handwrittenmathsymbols

Please make sure you have all appropriate libraries downloaded before running main.py.

Note that this project is called pi-math because we originally planned on having a Raspberry Pi be able to take a picture
of a problem and solve it itself, but we changed direction pretty early on.
Still kept the name though!

We hope you enjoy!
