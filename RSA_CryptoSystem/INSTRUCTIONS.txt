Hi there! This is a simple example of an RSA Cryptosystem.
I learned about it online and was intrigued by how matrices were used, so I decided to make one myself.

In message.txt, please input the message that you would like to encrypt or decrypt.

In nums.txt, please input two prime numbers; one on each line.
This will be your "encryption key".

After completing these two steps, run RSA_CryptoSystem.py.
It will ask you whether you would like to Encrypt or Decrypt, so please answer accordingly.
Note that in order to accurately decrypt a message, you must be using the same key that you used to encrypt it.

Once RSA_CryptoSystem is done, your ouput will be displayed in output.txt.

Have fun!
